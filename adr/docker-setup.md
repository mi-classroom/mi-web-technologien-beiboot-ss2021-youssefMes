# Setup

## Status

Implemented

## Context

To assure application portability across multiple platforms the application is to be containerized and setting up every dependency manually has to be avoided to reduce time of every first installation

## Decision

Based on some existing experience, the decision was made to use Docker + docker-compose.

## Consequences

the use of docker will reduce the amount of the time for anyone who wants to start the project, in the other hand it will take some effort to implement a fully automated environment
